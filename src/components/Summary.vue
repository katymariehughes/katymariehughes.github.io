    I am a passionate person with an acute curiosity, eagerness to learn, and positive attitude.<br/><br/>
    
    With valuable experience as a full stack .NET developer in both consultancy
    and in-house roles, I have been afforded an exposure to a vast array of
    business domains, and have held responsibilities spanning the entire
    lifecycle of business applications:
    <code class="bg-gray-50 text-xs px-1 py-1 rounded-md italic">
      requirements analysis, design, software architecture, coding, logging,
      debugging, unit and automation testing, deployment and CI/CD.
    </code><br/><br/>

    Taking ownership of projects from conception to completion and driving positive change through digital transformation forms the core of what I do. 
    Advocating for the best solution for both the end user and company takes priority - even if it means failing fast in the search for it.<br/><br/>

    I write clean, performant and scaleable code, whether for backend REST APIs, event-driven microservice architectures or responsive web applications, utilising an extensive knowledge of the ASP.NET (Core & Framework) platform.
    All work is guided by domain driven design (DDD) principles and best practices, and I seek to develop content-driven solutions not only rich in functionality, 
    but that most importantly demonstrate a sincere understanding of the business domain. By showing initiative and
    challenging assumptions, I can pinpoint the most appropriate solution to a
    given problem, articulate the proposal to stakeholders, evangelise within
    the development team and ultimately implement it.<br/><br/>
    
    My degree in mathematics, as well as my work experience, combined with the ability to very quickly adapt makes me an ideal candidate for this role.
    I am a great communicator who flourishes in a team environment centred on trust, collaboration and empowerment. 
    This enables me to work effectively both internally and with domain experts to identify requirements and architect and implement a complete solution.<br/><br/>
    
    The opportunity to join your team to further hone my craft in a new domain excites me greatly, and I'm looking forward to understanding how I may add value to your company and mission.
